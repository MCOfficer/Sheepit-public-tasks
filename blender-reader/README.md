The goal is read the content of a Blender file without launching blender.

There is a working solution on BlenderReaderWithLaunchingBlenderBinary, it launchs blender on every read.

It's not a goold solution because it could take a lot of ressources, specialy on the ram usage.

I'm looking for a better way to read the infos.

I put a phpunit test so you can check if your solution is ok.
