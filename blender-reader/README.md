The goal is read the content of a Blender file without launching blender.

There is a working solution on BlenderReaderWithLaunchingBlenderBinary, it launchs blender on every read.
It issue it loads the actual blender so it could take a lot of ressources, specialy on the ram usage.

I'm looking for a better way to read the infos.

I put a php unit test so you can know if your solution is ok.
